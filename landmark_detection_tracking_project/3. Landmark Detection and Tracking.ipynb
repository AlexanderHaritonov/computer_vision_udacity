    "# Project 3:  Implement SLAM \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement SLAM for robot that moves and senses in a 2 dimensional, grid world!\n",
    "\n",
    "SLAM gives us a way to both localize a robot and build up a map of its environment as a robot moves and senses in real-time. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems. Since this localization and map-building relies on the visual sensing of landmarks, this is a computer vision problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using what you've learned about robot motion, representations of uncertainty in motion and sensing, and localization techniques, you will be tasked with defining a function, `slam`, which takes in six parameters as input and returns the vector `mu`. \n",
    "> `mu` contains the (x,y) coordinate locations of the robot as it moves, and the positions of landmarks that it senses in the world\n",
    "\n",
    "You can implement helper functions as you see fit, but your function must return `mu`. The vector, `mu`, should have (x, y) coordinates interlaced, for example, if there were 2 poses and 2 landmarks, `mu` will look like the following, where `P` is the robot position and `L` the landmark position:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mu =  matrix([[Px0],\n",
    "              [Py0],\n",
    "              [Px1],\n",
    "              [Py1],\n",
    "              [Lx0],\n",
    "              [Ly0],\n",
    "              [Lx1],\n",
    "              [Ly1]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that `mu` holds the poses first `(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...,` then the landmark locations at the end of the matrix; we consider a `nx1` matrix to be a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating an environment\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real SLAM problem, you may be given a map that contains information about landmark locations, and in this example, we will make our own data using the `make_data` function, which generates a world grid with landmarks in it and then generates data by placing a robot in that world and moving and sensing over some numer of time steps. The `make_data` function relies on a correct implementation of robot move/sense functions, which, at this point, should be complete and in the `robot_class.py` file. The data is collected as an instantiated robot moves and senses in a world. Your SLAM function will take in this data as input. So, let's first create this data and explore how it represents the movement and sensor measurements that our robot takes.\n",

    "`data` holds the sensors measurements and motion of your robot over time. It stores the measurements as `data[i][0]` and the motion as `data[i][1]`.\n",

Recall that `omega` holds the weights of each variable and `xi` holds the value of the sum of these variables, as seen in Notebook 2. You'll need the `world_size` to determine the starting pose of the robot in the world and fill in the initial values for `xi`."

    "Recall that `omega` holds the relative \"strengths\" or weights for each position variable, and you can update these weights by accessing the correct index in omega `omega[row][col]` and *adding/subtracting* `1.0/noise` where `noise` is measurement or motion noise. `Xi` holds actual position values, and so to update `xi` you'll do a similar addition process only using the actual value of a motion or measurement. So for a vector index `xi[row][0]` you will end up adding/subtracting one measurement or motion divided by their respective `noise`.\n",

    "#### Updating with motion and measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "With a 2D omega and xi structure as shown above (in earlier cells), you'll have to be mindful about how you update the values in these constraint matrices to account for motion and measurement constraints in the x and y directions. Recall that the solution to these matrices (which holds all values for robot poses `P` and landmark locations `L`) is the vector, `mu`, which can be computed at the end of the construction of omega and xi as the inverse of omega times xi: $\\mu = \\Omega^{-1}\\xi$\n",
